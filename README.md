## jUnit5 : from @Test up to your own Extensions
With JUnit 5 we have a new JUnit written entirely from scratch. 
We will have some exercises to see how we can create Extensions to customize jUnit 5.


## Web apps done by a backend developer
With Vaadin you can quickly create a server-side web application as a Java or Kotlin developer. 
All without HTML or JavaScript. 
In these practical exercises, we'll take the first steps to create a small web application 
in Java, Kotlin or both.

## Mutation Testing Hands-on
TDD is a powerful technique, but it depends on the developer skill and preferences. 
With Mutation Testing, you can increase your quality, and it will help you to deliver the best test coverage, compared to pure line coverage. 
We will have a few practical exercises giving you the first step towards using mutation testing in your next project.

This exercises are the practical follow up of my talk 
[Start hunting the bugs - Mutation-Testing](https://vxdmelbourne2019.confinabox.com/talk/UWE-9156/Start_hunting_the_bugs_.._Mutation_Testing)

## Microstream a new way to store Java-Objects
With these exercises, I want to show a new, nearly unknown project that will give you a way to persist Java-Objects. 
How this is used and what is the difference compared to existing solutions like mapdDB?
